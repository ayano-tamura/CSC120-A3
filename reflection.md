- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It was a mixed feeling between "it was easier than I thought" and "this is very different from Python". Learning a new language is difficult, but I was able to figure out the basic steps and attributes, classes, etc. easier than I thought. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I thought it was interesting how Python takes indentation into account when nesting different variables, whereas indentation can be used in Java for clarity purposes only and is not necessary. Java seems to require more specific information in terms of which information will be made public and private. In python, integers and strings for example do not need to be specified but in Java, you would have to specify which one you will be using in the code prior to printing it out. Additionally, since Python runs line by line, the code runs up until the error code. However, for Java, the code as a whole does not run unless you fix all bugs in the code. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I had some trouble implementing the if statements into the code, with replacing the words. I had similar difficulty in Python in separating words, but I was able to figure it out, and my TA also taught me to put all of the conditions in one if statements. I am curious to find out how to change the code so the bot accounts for more word replacements.
